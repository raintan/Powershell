# Powershell Scripts

I created this repository for all the powershell scripts that I cobble together to help me do things at work.

**WatchedFolderPrinter:**
This script will watch a folder for a file to be created and then prints the file to a printer. This script could also be modified to perform any action on file creation (there are other trigers as well).
