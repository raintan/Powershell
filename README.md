# Powershell Scripts

I created this repository for all the powershell scripts that I cobble together to help me do things at work.

**WatchedFolderPrinter:**
This script will watch a folder (and optionaly subfolders) for a file to be created (or optionally Changed, Deleted or Renamed) and then prints the file to a printer. This script could also be modified to perform any action on a specified event.
