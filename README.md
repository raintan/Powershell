# Powershell Scripts

I created this repository for all the powershell scripts that I cobble together to help me do things at work.

**WatchedFolderPrinter:**
This script will watch a folder (and optionaly subfolders) for a file to be created (or optionally Changed, Deleted or Renamed) and then prints the file to a printer. This script could also be modified to perform any action on a specified event. This was cobbled together from other scripts I found [here](https://superuser.com/questions/226828/how-to-monitor-a-folder-and-trigger-a-command-line-action-when-a-file-is-created), [here](http://ittande.blogspot.ca/2014/11/automatically-print-and-delete-pdfs.html) and [here](https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/143532-automatically-print-pdf-files-scanned-to-a-folder-using-powershell).
